# Notes

Small Screen set to 640 px according to project asset photo size

BONUS added- Created a sticky footer via bootstrap

All photos are personal photos to be used for this homework project only - Photos in Portfolio are placeholders for projects to hopefully be added in the future

A few CSS elements added for personal taste:

Bootstrap submit button in contact over-ruled to be pink in CSS

Border Radius around content

Icons for social media in contact
